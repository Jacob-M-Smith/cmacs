* Headers
** Split cmacs.h into many headers instead of monolith
*** This will probably create scope issues that need to be addressed
*** buffer.h, files.h, etc, etc
*** add headers into linker
*** Verify that everything functions as intended

* keybinds
** Add keybinds files into linker
** Slowly replace switch statement code with function pointer calls
** How should we properly index the array
** How do we handle meta and ctrlx keys?
*** Do they get separate keytables? probably

* Bottom menu
** Display current active file
** Acts as interface for selecting new files for buffering

* Multiple files
** Implement ctrl+x ctrl+f functionality
*** SHouldn't be too hard (most of the needed code is already there).
** Implement ctrl+x b to switch between buffers
** Implement save all buffers command

* Multi-window system
** Split screen in half for two buffers
** How on earth does one do that?
